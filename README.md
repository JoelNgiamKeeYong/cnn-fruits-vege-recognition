# üçé Fruits & Vegetables Recognition System using CNN

## üöÄ Business Scenario

Food classification using computer vision has many practical applications, from automated checkout systems to dietary tracking and food waste reduction. This project focuses on developing a **Fruits & Vegetables Recognition System** that can accurately classify images of fruits and vegetables using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** trained on a **Kaggle dataset**. A user-friendly interface is deployed for seamless interaction with the model, utilizing Streamlit for frontend development and Heroku for hosting the application.

## üß† Business Problem

Recognizing different fruits and vegetables in images is a challenging task due to variations in shape, color, and texture. The goal is to build an **image classification model** that can accurately predict the type of fruit or vegetable from an image, enabling applications in supermarkets, smart kitchens, and health tracking systems.

## üõ†Ô∏è Solution Approach

This project follows a **deep learning workflow** with the following steps:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Data Collection and Preprocessing**

- **Dataset**:
  - Used the **Fruits and Vegetables Image Recognition Dataset** from Kaggle ([Dataset Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kritikseth/fruit-and-vegetable-image-recognition)).
  - The data is not included in this directory due to file size constraints. To see the full dataset, see the Kaggle website link above.
- **Image Preprocessing**:
  - Resized images to **64x64 pixels** for uniform input size.
  - Applied **normalization** to scale pixel values between 0 and 1.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Model Building (CNN Architecture)**

- **Convolutional Layers**: Extracted spatial features from images.
- **Max-Pooling Layers**: Reduced dimensionality while preserving key information.
- **Flattening Layer**: Converted feature maps into a 1D array.
- **Fully Connected Layers (Dense Layers)**: Made final predictions using softmax activation.
- **Activation Functions**: Used **ReLU** for hidden layers and **softmax** for classification.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Model Training and Evaluation**

- **Loss Function**: Categorical Crossentropy (for multi-class classification).
- **Optimizer**: Adam optimizer for efficient learning.
- **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - **Accuracy**: Measures the proportion of correct predictions.
  - **Visualizations**: Created visualizations to understand model performance across validation and test sets.

## üìä Model Performance

| Metric              | Value |
| ------------------- | ----- |
| Training Accuracy   | 95.2% |
| Validation Accuracy | 91.9% |
| Loss (Validation)   | 0.24  |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Dataset Constraints**

- The dataset may not include all possible lighting conditions, backgrounds, or rare fruit varieties.
- Performance may decrease when tested on images outside the training distribution.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Model Generalization**

- The CNN model performs well on the provided dataset but may require fine-tuning for real-world applications with unseen data.

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Real-World Deployment**

- For real-time classification, additional optimizations like **quantization** or **TensorFlow Lite conversion** would be needed for deployment on edge devices.
